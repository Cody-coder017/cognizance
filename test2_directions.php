	<h1>Hand and Eye Coordination</h1>
	<h2>Directions</h2>

	<p>
	You must track a circle as it moves around your screen.
	Do this by keeping your finger on the circle as much as you can as it moves.
	In addition other objects may pop up on your screen.
	Make sure you count how many other shapes pop up as you are 
	following the circle.  
	This will track your hand eye coordination function,
	and peripheral vision.
